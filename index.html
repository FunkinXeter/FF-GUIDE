    <div>CORRUBI</div>
    <p>Corrubi is one of the antagonists of Forbidden Files, they do tend to get aggresive, they have 3 songs
        Deletion
        Data Restored
        C0RRUPT
        Deletion and Data Restored have basic mechanics, so they are fairly easy, C0RRUPT, on the other hand,
        C0RRUPT has very hard mechanics, and take time to understand, its very hard to beat as well
        Corrubi appears in some songs as well in the background
